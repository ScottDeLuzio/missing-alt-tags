Dashboard widget for displaying posts with missing alt tags in images

== Description ==
Provides a quick overview of any posts, pages, or CPTs on your site that include images with empty alt tags.

WordPress automatically adds `alt=\"\"` to images when no alt text is specified. This plugin will search for the string `alt=\"\"` in your posts, and return a list of posts that include that string.

This plugin will *not* find something like this: ``. 

It will find something like this: `\"\"`. 

== Installation ==
Install like any other WP plugin
